Step 1: Choose Your Smartwatch and Tracking Metrics
The first step is choosing a smartwatch that provides the diagnostics you're looking for. Some popular options include:

Apple Watch: Tracks heart rate, blood pressure (via third-party apps), steps, and sleep.
Garmin Watches: Provides metrics for heart rate, sleep, steps, stress, and more.
Fitbit: Tracks heart rate, steps, sleep, blood pressure (via third-party apps), and more.
Whoop Strap: Known for tracking recovery, heart rate variability (HRV), sleep, and strain levels.
Most of these smartwatches sync their data with a mobile app on your phone (like the Garmin Connect app, Fitbit App, or Apple Health App).

Step 2: Sync Your Smartwatch with an App
Ensure your smartwatch syncs all the diagnostic data to an app that can be used for further analysis. This data is typically synced to:

Apple Health (for iPhone and Apple Watch)
Google Fit (for Android)
Garmin Connect (for Garmin watches)
Fitbit App (for Fitbit devices)
Step 3: Set Up a Google Sheet to Log the Data
You can use Google Sheets to log the data from your smartwatch daily. Some apps, like Google Fit or Garmin Connect, allow you to export your data as CSV files. You can either import this data manually into Google Sheets or use an automation tool to update the sheet regularly.

Setting up a Google Sheet:
Create a Google Sheet with columns for the following metrics (or any others you want to track):

Date
Steps
Heart Rate
Blood Pressure (if available)
Sleep Quality
Any other metrics you want to track (e.g., calories burned, activity minutes).
Use Google Apps Script to send a daily reminder email or text based on the data:

You will need a script that checks your data each day and compares it against your targets to determine if you're doing well or not.
Step 4: Use Google Apps Script to Send Daily Reminders
You can automate notifications using Google Apps Script. This script will check the data from the previous day and send you an email or text message if you're doing well or need to work harder.
